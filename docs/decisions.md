# Architecture Decision Records

## ADR-001 — SQLite + WAL, not Postgres

**Status:** accepted

Single-user system (multi-device). Workload is sub-millisecond commits at tens of writes/sec at peak. Postgres requires a separate service that fights the local-first model. SQLite WAL handles the multi-process write contention — daemon, dashboard server proc, CLI inspections — without contention in practice. `busy_timeout=5000` mops up the rare collisions. One-file backup, content-addressed branch-isolation if we ever need it.

## ADR-002 — Daemon owns the Claude SDK; dashboard is auth + UI proxy

**Status:** accepted

Single SDK runtime keeps long-lived sessions, agent registry, fork pool, file watchers, and the EventBus all in one process. SvelteKit hot-reloads don't kill conversations. Auth boundary is clean: daemon binds to `127.0.0.1`, dashboard is the only public surface, CFT exposes only the dashboard.

## ADR-003 — Single SSE channel, NDJSON via SSE framing

**Status:** accepted

`EventSource('/api/events')` is the only persistent connection from the browser. Per-turn POST returns `{turn_id}` immediately; turn events flow on the same SSE channel tagged by `turn_id`. Native `Last-Event-ID` reconnect against the daemon's 200-event ring buffer.

## ADR-004 — DB write before SSE emit, with `last_event_seq` cursor

**Status:** accepted

Each event has a monotonic `seq`. The `turns` row is updated to `last_event_seq = N` *before* the event with that seq is broadcast. Browsers on focus switch / reconnect can read DB up to cursor K and live-render only events with `seq > K`. No double-application, no missed events.

## ADR-005 — Three-layer prompt stack: CONSTITUTION / SOUL / agent base

**Status:** accepted

`CONSTITUTION.md` is source-only, inviolate, prepended to every agent's system prompt. `SOUL.md` is the user's one override slot, copied to `~/.friday/SOUL.md` on first boot and never overwritten on upgrade. `agents/<type>.md` are role-specific bases, source-only. Protocols stack on top per agent. Skills inject per-turn. Memory auto-recall prepends to the user message.

## ADR-006 — Tickets table is system-agnostic; external systems join via `ticket_external_links`

**Status:** accepted

`tickets` doesn't know about Linear, GitHub, or any specific system. `ticket_external_links` carries `(ticket_id, system, external_id, url)` with the composite index `(system, external_id)`. Adding a new ticket integration is a sibling package, not a schema change.

## ADR-007 — Attachments dedup by DB row + sha-bucket disk path

**Status:** accepted

`attachments.sha256` is the PK. Upload flow: hash bytes → DB lookup by sha256 → reuse row if hit (re-write file on disk if missing). Storage path is `~/.friday/uploads/<sha-bucket>/<sha>.<ext>` where bucket is the first two hex chars (256 buckets) — content-addressed, time-independent.

## ADR-008 — No public sign-up, ever

**Status:** accepted

Single-user system. `friday setup` is the only path to create the primary account. The dashboard's `/api/auth/sign-up` endpoint is permanently disabled (`disableSignUp: true` in BetterAuth). Recovery via `friday setup --reset-password` on the host. No email-recovery, no SMS — recovery is "you have shell access where Friday lives."

## ADR-009 — Tmux-backed daemon supervision

**Status:** accepted

`friday start` launches daemon and dashboard inside a tmux session named `friday`. `friday stop` kills the session. `friday attach` opens the panes for live debugging. No launchd or systemd to configure. Restart-on-crash via tmux + a small wrapper.

## ADR-010 — `/scratch` spawns Bare agents, not Helpers

**Status:** accepted

User-spawned ad-hoc sessions use the existing Bare agent type. Bares already exist in the system as interactive-but-headless agents (used for evolve enrichment, etc.). Promoting them to first-class chat citizens avoids duplicating Helper's purpose. Helpers remain orchestrator-spawned for scoped sub-tasks.
