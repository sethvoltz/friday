# Friday

A local-first, headless agent daemon with a SvelteKit dashboard exposed via Cloudflare Tunnel. See `docs/` for full documentation.

## Documentation

- `README.md` — Top-of-repo overview: tagline, features, quick start, CLI reference, project layout, docs index. **Public-facing.** First thing visitors read.
- `docs/architecture.md` — System overview, components, topology, wire protocol, prompt stack, agent lifecycle.
- `docs/chat-ux.md` — Single-chat UX, sidebar, focus model, slash commands, attachments, markdown rendering.
- `docs/mobile-ux.md` — Priority+ navigation, virtualization, PWA, mobile autocomplete.
- `docs/mcp.md` — MCP server surface table (Friday + user-configured).
- `docs/sandbox.md` — Worker isolation: M1–M5 rollout (PreToolUse rules, sandbox-exec, pgrp containment, stall watchdog) + residual risk.
- `docs/decisions.md` — ADRs + watch list.
- Schema reference: `packages/shared/src/db/schema.ts` (Drizzle source of truth; migrations under `packages/shared/drizzle/`). Includes the FRI-24 `memory_entries.embedding vector(384)` pgvector column for semantic recall — server-side-only, NOT replicated to Zero (like `content_tsv`; ADR-025). The pgvector extension is created via an admin connection in `ensureVectorExtension()` (pg-provision.ts), NOT inside a migration — `CREATE EXTENSION vector` needs superuser and the `friday` role lacks it. The embedding runtime is onnxruntime-web (WASM) — its `.wasm` files ship in the release tarball's `node_modules`, so there's NO per-platform native binary to fetch and it runs cross-platform (Intel x64 + Apple Silicon). Only the embedding model + tokenizer cache on disk under `<FRIDAY_DATA_DIR>/models/` (quantized ONNX, all-MiniLM-L6-v2), fetched at `friday update`/setup and degrading fail-open to FTS-only if absent. No embedding secret exists — nothing is added to `.env` or the age vault (net `.env` reduction, by construction).
- `docs/roadmap.md` — Open work, sequenced for execution.
- `docs/setup.md` — Setup guide including CFT walkthrough.
- `docs/running.md` — How to run the daemon and dashboard.
- `docs/self-hosted-runner.md` — Setting up the Intel x64 self-hosted GitHub Actions runner that builds the `darwin-x64` release leg (prereqs, registration, launchd service, PATH/`gh` gotchas, troubleshooting).
- `docs/ui-conventions.md` — Cross-cutting UI patterns: `+`/`−` disclosure glyphs, agent-type icon map.

### Keeping docs and README in sync

Treat `README.md` as part of the documentation surface, not an afterthought. When work changes anything a newcomer would learn from the README — features, CLI commands, prerequisites, setup steps, project layout, `~/.friday/` contents, topology, supported integrations — update the README in the same change that updates `docs/`. Do not wait for "a docs pass later."

Specifically, before considering a task done, check whether your change touches:

- **A user-visible feature** described in the README's "Key features" section → update the matching bullet.
- **A CLI command** (added, renamed, removed, or changed flags) → update the "CLI" section _and_ `docs/running.md`.
- **Setup prerequisites** (Brewfile entries, Node version, required env vars) → update "Quick start" _and_ `docs/setup.md`.
- **Project structure** (new package, moved service, renamed directory) → update the "Project structure" tree _and_ the structure block at the top of this CLAUDE.md.
- **`~/.friday/` layout** (new file, renamed directory) → update the `~/.friday/` block in the README _and_ `docs/running.md`.
- **Topology / wire protocol** (new public process, new auth boundary) → update the topology diagram _and_ `docs/architecture.md`.
- **Docs themselves** (new doc page, renamed, removed) → update the README's "Documentation" table _and_ the list above in this CLAUDE.md.

A docs-only change still warrants a commit with scope `docs`. A code change that lands without its README/docs counterpart is incomplete work, not "fast iteration."

## Design Principles

- **Preserve over delete.** Default to keeping data. Patch and update rather than delete.
- **Workspace containment.** Builders work exclusively in their assigned worktrees.
- **User approval gates.** The orchestrator confirms plans with the user before creating Builders.
- **Static imports only.** No inline `require()` or dynamic `import()` inside function bodies. Two exceptions: (a) tests; (b) **lazy-loading a heavy/optional dependency that must stay out of processes that don't use it** — e.g. the `onnxruntime-web` + `@huggingface/transformers` stack (~240 MB resident) is loaded only via `await import(...)` inside `packages/memory/src/embed-runtime.ts`, which runs exclusively in the forked embedding child, so importing `@friday/memory` from the daemon or CLI never drags ORT into those processes. A lazy `import()` under exception (b) MUST carry a comment at the import site stating which process it's keeping the dependency out of and why a static import is wrong. If you reach for a dynamic import, it must fit (a) or (b) — otherwise use a static import.

Installed Friday Apps live under `~/.friday/apps/<id>/` (override with `FRIDAY_DATA_DIR`). See ADR-021 and `docs/architecture.md` for the platform.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test               # unit suite (fast — no subprocesses)
pnpm test:e2e           # multi-subprocess e2e (daemon + dashboard + zero-cache against scratch PG); slow
pnpm test:playwright    # browser-driven user-visible round-trip; slowest, needs chromium installed
pnpm test:clean         # reclaim leaked test artifacts (orphan tmp data dirs + idle scratch DBs); run when no test run is in progress
pnpm --filter @friday/daemon exec vitest run src/path/to/file.test.ts
```

- TypeScript throughout, Vitest for tests, pnpm workspaces + Turborepo.
- Tests are co-located with source as `*.test.ts`. Files named `*.e2e.test.ts` are heavy multi-subprocess suites — excluded from `pnpm test`, run via `pnpm test:e2e`. The Playwright browser suite lives in `services/dashboard/e2e/`.
- All state lives in `~/.friday/` (override with `FRIDAY_DATA_DIR`). Never hardcode paths; use constants from `@friday/shared`.
- Test files that touch `~/.friday/` state must set `process.env.FRIDAY_DATA_DIR = <tmpdir>` **before** importing any `@friday/shared` DB/data-dir machinery. The import is what binds the data-dir constants; setting the env after the import is too late and trashes the real prod data dir. A vitest setup file at `packages/shared/src/test/vitest-setup.ts` is wired into every package's `vitest.config.ts` as a backstop — it forces `FRIDAY_DATA_DIR` to a fresh tmpdir if unset, and throws if it's set to the real `~/.friday/`. Do not bypass it; individual test files can still set their own scoped `FRIDAY_DATA_DIR` if they need isolation between files within a worker. The tmpdir the setup creates is reclaimed automatically — each created dir is recorded in a per-run manifest and removed by a `globalSetup` teardown after the run (`packages/shared/src/test/{global-setup,tmp-data-dir}.ts`), which fires even when a file is fully skipped or its worker is killed; a startup sweep reclaims crash orphans from prior runs, and a caller-provided `FRIDAY_DATA_DIR` is adopted and never deleted. Every vitest config that wires `vitest-setup.ts` must also wire `global-setup.ts` (pinned by `vitest-config-wiring.test.ts`). `pnpm test:clean` is the manual catch-all (also drops idle `friday_test_*` scratch DBs).
- `@friday/shared` is consumed via its built `dist/`. When you edit shared source, run `pnpm --filter @friday/shared build` before exercising the change in the daemon or dashboard.

## Database migrations

Friday uses Drizzle ORM with the Postgres adapter (Postgres replaced SQLite per ADR-023). Drizzle's Postgres migrator filters journal entries by their `when` field against `__drizzle_migrations.created_at` — **not by `idx` or filename order**. A migration whose `when` is less than the current max `created_at` in the DB is silently skipped (no error, no log). One bad `when` poisons every later migration on every machine that has already applied the bad row. The mechanics are the same as they were under SQLite; the rules are the same.

**Rules — non-negotiable:**

1. **The `when` field in `packages/shared/drizzle/meta/_journal.json` MUST be a real `Date.now()` captured at the moment the migration was generated. NEVER fabricate, round, hand-type, or copy-paste a "looks plausible" value. NEVER pick a future date.** Round numbers ending in `00000` and future-dated values are immediate red flags — both have appeared in this repo via agent-authored migrations and silently broke the chain.
2. **Prefer `drizzle-kit generate`** — it writes `Date.now()` for you and keeps the snapshot chain consistent. Run `pnpm --filter @friday/shared exec drizzle-kit generate` whenever the schema in `packages/shared/src/db/schema.ts` changes.
3. **Hand-authored migrations are allowed only for data fixes and release-boundary markers** (cases where `drizzle-kit` has no diff to emit, e.g. `UPDATE …` data backfills or `SELECT 1;` markers that pin a value to a release). When you must add a journal entry by hand: use the actual current `Date.now()` (e.g. paste the output of `node -e "console.log(Date.now())"` _at the moment you author the entry_) — never a rounded approximation, never a future value, and always strictly greater than the previous entry's `when`.
4. **`runMigrations()` asserts that journal entry count equals `__drizzle_migrations` row count** after every run and throws if they diverge. If you ever see `drizzle journal/db mismatch` at boot, do not "fix" it by deleting rows — diagnose which `when` is wrong and correct both the journal _and_ the DB's `created_at`.
5. **Migrations run on daemon boot, before zero-cache reconnects.** The startup sequence is: Postgres (host-managed) → daemon (runs migrations, **then reconciles the `friday_pub` Zero publication** — ADR-045, see gotcha #2 below — opens LISTEN, starts SSE) → zero-cache (picks up the new schema via logical replication) → dashboard (proxies WS + SSE + mutators) → clients reload on schema-version mismatch. **Never run migrations from the dashboard or from a builder's worktree against the user's `friday` database** — only daemon boot runs them.

These rules apply to Builders and any other agent working in a worktree of this repo. If you find yourself reaching for `1779…00000`-shaped timestamps, stop.

## Upgrade gotchas — check every one of these when your change ships in a release

These are concrete failure modes that have each broken a real `friday update` deploy (silent reload loops, boot crash-loops, bricked installs). A change is **not done** until you've checked the ones it touches. "It works in dev" does not clear these — dev re-runs `friday setup` / rebuilds constantly and masks every one of them. The shared root cause across most of them: **`friday update` runs the OUTGOING version's `update` command, then flips the `current` symlink** — so anything a release needs done on the hop _into_ it must live on the **boot/start path** (always the new code via `current/.../friday-supervisor`), never in `update.ts` (always the old code).

1. **Drizzle `when` timestamps** — covered exhaustively above. The #1 silent upgrade-bricker. Real `Date.now()`, strictly increasing, never rounded, never future. A bad `when` skips silently and poisons every later migration on every box that applied the bad row.

2. **New Zero-replicated table → add it to `SYNC_TABLES` AND the Zero sync schema.** A table that the browser's Zero schema (`packages/shared/src/sync/schema.ts`) knows but `friday_pub` (`SYNC_TABLES` in `pg-provision.ts`) does not makes zero-cache reject every client with `SchemaVersionNotSupported`, and the dashboard's mismatch guard reload-loops the page forever — page + tunnel look fine, only live sync is dead. `reconcileSyncPublication` now reconciles `friday_pub` on every daemon boot (ADR-045), so adding the table to **both** lists is sufficient — but if you add it to only one, you reintroduce the loop. (Bit `evolve_proposals` once, then `habits`/`habit_checkins` on the first update-only deploy that shipped them.) Symptom to recognize: dashboard log shows `GET /` every ~2s each with a fresh Zero `clientID` + empty `baseCookie`; zero-cache log shows `SchemaVersionNotSupported`.

3. **New hard runtime dependency (native binary / Postgres extension) → provision on the boot/start path, not `update.ts`.** Provisioning wired into `friday update` can never run on the hop _into_ the release that introduced it (self-referential update gap, ADR-044). pgvector's `CREATE EXTENSION vector` needs SUPERUSER (the `friday` migration role isn't), so it can't live in a migration either — it goes through `ensureVectorExtension` / `friday provision`, gated by the supervisor preflight (`checkDeps`). Symptom: boot crash-loop with `type "vector" does not exist`.

4. **Adding a table/column that Zero replicates may require a zero-cache replica reset.** zero-cache's `autoReset` (Zero default `true`) wipes + re-COPYs when the replicated table set changes, so the reconcile in #2 normally self-heals. If a box is stuck with a stale replica, the manual recovery is: stop stack → delete `~/.friday/zero/replica.db*` → start stack (it re-COPYs from canonical Postgres; the replica is a cache, never canonical). Never hand-edit Postgres to "match" the replica.

5. **Release tarball symlinks must be relative.** `pnpm` produces absolute symlinks on CI runners; `pack.mjs` rewrites them to relative in the staged tree. Absolute links escape the install dir and broke the v1.1.0 install. If you touch `pack.mjs` or the staged `node_modules` layout, verify links resolve _inside_ `versions/<v>/` after extraction.

6. **Never hand-edit a `"version"` field** — release-please owns all 8 in lockstep (`release-please-config.json` `extra-files`). A drifted version breaks `friday --version` and the lockstep invariant.

7. **The Intel (`darwin-x64`) self-hosted runner must be online + idle before a Release PR merges** — it builds the x64 release leg and gates the published `VERSION`. A merged Release PR with the runner offline yields a release missing its Intel artifacts.

8. **Workspace-dep builds in a fresh worktree.** `@friday/shared` (and `memory`/`evolve`/`integrations-linear`) are consumed via `dist/`; a fresh worktree has none, so `tsc`/e2e fail with phantom `Cannot find module '@friday/*'` errors that read like real bugs. Run `pnpm --filter @friday/shared build` (or `pnpm -w build`) before exercising or typechecking. Pre-commit `turbo build` can also fail spuriously on a stale shared `dist` from the main repo's `.turbo/cache` — fix with `TURBO_FORCE=true git commit`, never `--no-verify`.

## Debugging

- **Trust the user; verify the system.** Seth is a developer who speaks precisely — "I didn't click X" means he didn't click X. Investigate the system, not the user. Never offer "you probably did Y by accident" as an explanation when you can't find a code path; that's the shape of giving up dressed as a hypothesis. You may _ask_ a clarifying question when you genuinely need one ("did you have another tab open?", "what did the network panel show?"), but the burden of proof sits on the code, not on his behavior.

- **Don't assume — research.** When two thorough passes through the code don't explain a symptom, stop reading the same files harder and switch tools. The answer is in the logs, the DB, the SSE stream, or temporary instrumentation — not in another round of speculation. A proposed cause without a backing log line, DB row, or network event is a _hypothesis_, not a diagnosis; flag it as such when reporting and say what evidence would confirm or kill it. Two unproductive code-reading rounds is the signal to gather evidence, not the signal to write a longer write-up.

- **Logs live under `~/.friday/`** (override with `FRIDAY_DATA_DIR`). Path resolution is `getLogPath(service)` in `packages/shared/src/config.ts`.
  - `logs/daemon.jsonl` — every daemon event in JSONL. Useful event names to grep for: `worker.fork`, `worker.prompt.queued`, `worker.exit`, `worker.turn.stalled`, `worker.abort.force-kill`, `block.seq-skew`, `blocks.update.error`, `chat.turn.user-block.error`, `queued-block.meta-update.error`, `jsonl-recovery.post-turn.error`, `daemon.shutdown`, `daemon.ready`, `pg.listen.<channel>`, `mutator.<name>.execute`, `mutator.<name>.fast-path`. `tail -F` works fine; entries are one JSON per line.
  - `logs/dashboard-<ts>-<id>.jsonl[.gz]` — per-session rotating dashboard logs. Includes mutator-execution logs (`mutator.<name>.received` / `mutator.<name>.committed`).
  - `logs/zero-cache.jsonl` — zero-cache process log (verbosity configurable via `ZERO_LOG_LEVEL`).
  - `logs/tunnel.log` — cloudflared plain text (only file in this dir that isn't JSONL).
- **Canonical state lives in Postgres** (database `friday`, host-managed via `brew services`). When a bubble's visual state disagrees with reality, the Postgres row is the source of truth and the next question is "which write path produced that status?" Useful queries:
  - `psql friday -c "SELECT block_id, turn_id, role, kind, status, ts, streaming FROM blocks WHERE turn_id = '…' ORDER BY ts;"` — what blocks does Postgres actually have for this turn? Note `streaming=1` rows shouldn't appear (the daemon writes rows only on close); if you see one, something wrote a partial row out-of-spec.
  - `psql friday -c "SELECT name, status, archive_reason FROM agents WHERE name = '…';"` — what's the registry's view of this agent?
  - `psql friday -c "SELECT * FROM blocks WHERE status='pending' ORDER BY ts;"` — pending mutators that haven't been picked up yet (should drain quickly; persistent rows mean the daemon's LISTEN handler or boot recovery is wedged).
  - `psql friday -c "SELECT pg_notification_queue_usage();"` — how full is Postgres's pending-notification queue? Should be near 0; persistent non-zero means a LISTENer is hung.

## Versioning

A single semver version spans all 8 `package.json` files (root + 7 workspace packages), driven by **release-please** (ADR-034, FRI-146). The root is bumped natively via `release-type: node`; the 7 workspace packages are bumped in lockstep via `extra-files` in `release-please-config.json`. **Never hand-edit a `"version"` field** — release-please owns them. `friday --version` reads `packages/cli/package.json`'s `version` (a static `import … with { type: "json" }`), so it equals the cli package version, which equals the system version by lockstep construction.

Pre-1.0, `bump-minor-pre-major: true` is set (release-please's default is `false`, which would MAJOR-bump on `BREAKING CHANGE`): `feat:` → minor, `fix:` → patch, `BREAKING CHANGE` → minor. The v1.0.0 cutover playbook lives in ADR-034.

`bootstrap-sha` in `release-please-config.json` anchors release-please's **first** run: it parses only commits landing _after_ that SHA, so the initial `0.1.0` changelog is scoped to the release window rather than the full repo history. It is pinned to the FRI-146 merge-base; if the pipeline is re-bootstrapped on a fresh fork, update it to the new anchor commit (or delete the key to scan from the start).

## Commits

Conventional Commits. Scopes: `daemon`, `dashboard`, `shared`, `cli`, `memory`, `evolve`, `integrations`, `apps`, `docs`, `ci`. Use `system` for cross-cutting changes. release-please parses the Conventional Commit **type** (`feat:` / `fix:` / `BREAKING CHANGE`) on the squash-merge subject to drive the version bump (see Versioning), so an accurate type is load-bearing, not cosmetic.
