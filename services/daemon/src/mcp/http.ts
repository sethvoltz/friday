/**
 * HTTP helper for MCP tool handlers running inside worker forks.
 *
 * Workers reconstruct MCP servers locally after fork; handlers reach the
 * daemon's authoritative state by hitting 127.0.0.1:<daemonPort>. This keeps
 * the daemon as the sole writer of SQLite (per docs/architecture.md) and
 * routes tool invocations through the same endpoints the dashboard uses.
 *
 * Requests inject the same-host shared secret on every call so endpoints
 * gated by `authorizeSameHost` (e.g. `/api/apps/*`, `/api/uploads`) accept
 * them. Non-gated endpoints ignore the header, so injecting unconditionally
 * is safe and keeps the helper uniform.

 * Extract the AbortSignal from the SDK's `extra` argument passed to MCP tool

 * `RequestHandlerExtra`, which carries `signal: AbortSignal`). When the user
 * hits Stop or the worker's `abortController` fires, the SDK signals every
 * in-flight handler via this signal — pass it into `daemonFetch` and the
 * worker stops blocking on the daemon's response immediately. See FRI-66 and
 * ADR-030 for the daemon-side semantics (writes still complete server-side;
