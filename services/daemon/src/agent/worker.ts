 * `autoCompactThreshold` reflects the configured window — and, if the setting

 * documented SDK gap. The probe verdict drives nothing directly; the documented

 * `/compact` on its own timer at the 60K budget regardless of whether the SDK
 * ceiling takes effect — so context is bounded even when this probe reports
 * `takes_effect:false`.
 *
 * Best-effort and FULLY isolated: the probe is one `getContextUsage()` control
 * round-trip that never throws into the turn (any failure is swallowed and
 * logged as `takes_effect:false`). `getContextUsage` is absent on the mocked
 * iterator in some unit tests, so the method-presence guard is load-bearing.
 *
 * "Takes effect" means the SDK reports auto-compaction ENABLED and a numeric
 * `autoCompactThreshold` at or below the configured window — i.e. the window
 * (or something tighter) is the live ceiling. A missing threshold, disabled
 * auto-compaction, or a threshold larger than the window all mean the setting
 * did not flow through and the fallback is documented.

  //     on the PreToolUse hook above). Prefer the hook input's `session_id`
