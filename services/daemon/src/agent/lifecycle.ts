/**
 * Worker lifecycle: forks per-agent processes, owns the IPC channel, and
 * routes events to the daemon's eventBus. Each forked worker can be either
 * one-shot (scheduled) or long-lived (orchestrator/builder/helper/bare).
 *
 * Long-lived semantics:
 *   - The first turn arrives via spawnTurn() with the initial prompt.
 *   - Subsequent turns arrive via dispatchTurn(); if the agent is already
 *     live we send a `prompt` IPC instead of forking.
 *   - turn-complete from the worker emits `turn_done` and inserts usage,
 *     but does NOT shut the worker down — the worker drives its own loop
 *     (drain mail, idle, repeat).
 *   - If a new prompt arrives while the worker is mid-turn, we queue it
 *     parent-side and flush on the next turn-complete so events from the
 *     in-flight turn keep their original turn_id.

 *
 * Bug #2: the old exit handler finalized streaming blocks and reset the row to
 * `idle` but never published `turn_done`, so the dashboard's inflight turn pin
 * stayed up forever even though the agent was dispatchable. The `hard-exit`
 * Transition publishes the missing `turn_done{status:"error"}` (plus the

 *
 * F1-A archived guard: if the row is already terminal (`archived` — a row a
 * racing archive committed), DO NOT heal it to `idle`; the archive's
 * workspace-cleanup half would otherwise race the wrong status. Read the row
 * first and skip the whole Transition for an archived agent. (The pre-M5 guard
 * also checked `!== "error"`; the agent-status `error` was pruned in M5, so the
 * archived check is the only terminal state left to preserve.)
